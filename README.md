# 3DWorldTimer (TDWTimer)

This is a small program to help run 3D World. I got tired of using spreadsheets.

## For Runners
The CSV file in src/assets/run contains the programmed route. Modify to your liking.

### Controls
Left/Down: Go forward in the run

Right/Up: Go backward in the run

1-3, 5, 10: Inputs that number of stars as "gotten" for currently selected level

Spacebar: Start/stop timer

### I'm not technical, how do I just run this?
In releases there is a compiled version. The assets folder still exists to easily change out your csv file. Just run index.html and it should be a gravyboat.
